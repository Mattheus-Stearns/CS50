                    <p>
                        I like to write.... so here is the begginings of a fic that I have written.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Blurb</h3>

                    <p>
                        A boy has been showered with love and affection from those he holds dear. 
                        However, other people are a different matter. He is a genius - a genius at learning. 
                        This has caused him to isolate himself from society. He takes up the sword and tries 
                        learning magic on the side to pass the time. He knows that he has no chance in society 
                        unless he becomes a blade worth enough keeping around. He does not trust society. 
                        Nor does he trust his teachers. So everything, he has to teach himself. 
                        There are very few life paths for someone of his caliber, so he plans to become a mercenary. 
                        Of world renown. He becomes stronger, honing his blade. Eventually, he becomes strong enough 
                        to challenge even the peak. He has little human connection, only to his family, and his close friends. 
                        They watch him, as everyone else, and come to their conclusions about him. Some say he is a monster, 
                        those close to him are jealous of him, and those closer still pity him. They could not be further from the truth...
                    </p>

                    <h3>Chapter 1 - Beginnings</h3>

                    <p>
                        He opened his eyes, barely aware of his surroundings. He could not see much, for everything was blurry, 
                        but he could feel a warm presence that he was in the arms of. He looked at that being, and it was sound asleep. 
                        He felt that he shared blood with whatever this was. He closed his eyes. <br><br>

                        He opened his eyes. He could see much more than what he could at the beginning. 
                        He looked around, but could only see the ceiling, being firmly swaddled in clothes. 
                        He felt hungry and thirsty, so he called for his father. The presence that was at his 
                        side at the very beginning. "I am hungry and thirsty Dad!" The man stumbled into his room, 
                        bleary-eyed from a lack of sleep. All the man could hear was the wails of his kid, but the 
                        man knew that he was hungry and thirsty. He was always hungry and thirsty. "Hey, Ed, I am 
                        getting Mom, so you can relax." Ed, or Educus, he had forgotten that was his name. 
                        Ed closed his eyes. A woman came in shortly thereafter and nursed Ed. If you looked closely, 
                        you could see that Ed was more relaxed. <br><br>

                        Ed was crawling now, and he had become cognizant enough to start exploring his room. 
                        All of the boxes on the shelves were these things called books, and they had lots 
                        of knowledge in them. He didn't understand the characters yet, but he promised himself 
                        that he soon would. It would be rude to not read something made for being read. His 
                        room was in what used to be purely a small library, mainly of handwritten notebooks. 
                        His parents were some sort of teachers at an academy, but that was as much as he knew. 
                        He also finally got the names of his parents, because he started babbling. 
                        Dad was Theodore Humblecrest, and Mom was Ariadne Sagesurge. They had made it a competition 
                        to see who would get Ed to say their name first. Dad would practice saying "Th-e-o", whereas 
                        Mom would be saying "A-r-i". Those were the names that they used for each other. Secretly, 
                        though, Theo would be teaching Ed how to say "A-r-i". Anyhow, Ed was getting tired, 
                        so he crawled back to his crib, forgetting the open book left on the floor. The book that 
                        Ed was so trying to read. <br><br>

                        After Ed started walking, he got out of his room. He found out that he lived in a cottage, 
                        on a small mound that was a short commute from the capitol. By now, his parents judged it 
                        safe for them to resume teaching simultaneously, instead of alternating days. 
                        By Ed's fifth birthday, Theo had gotten him a wooden sword and a blank leather-bound book, 
                        and Ari had gotten him a focus and a nice quill, with ink of course. It was with this 
                        book that Theo began his studies because he had three years of absolute freedom before 
                        he enrolled in the academy in the capital. <br> <br>

                        He began to take notes on what he knew: <br> <br>

                        He lived in a world called Lumiere. On this world, which was spherical (or, that was at least an approximation 
                        - it was more accurately described as an ellipsoid), he lived on a continent called Eleganz, in an empire 
                        that had consumed the whole continent and thereby named itself after the continent, the land becoming 
                        indistinguishable from the state. The state uses a feudal system, where each region is ruled by a king, 
                        broken up into kingdoms, and they all have an emperor above them. Below the kings, are the grand dukes, then dukes, 
                        margraves, counts, earls, viscounts, barons, lords, imperial knights, knights, knight bachelors, lords of manors, 
                        esquires, and gentlemen. <br><br>

                        Of course, the civilians are at the bottom of the ladder. The ladder is not that clear, but then if it was that 
                        would not be interesting. To be awarded nobility, you must acquire a piece of land, and because the amount of land 
                        that exists is fixed, there is no such thing as new nobility. So, everyone fights to be above their station. However, 
                        the system is just. No one starves, because to possess nobility you have to be appointed by, and care for, your vassals. 
                        Everyone has roofs over their head, and the era is that of a renaissance. It is nearing the third century of the birth 
                        of the empire, and it is still as strong, if not stronger than its beginning. <br><br>

                        Academia is a field that has had time to grow and with the presence of the Royal Academy in the capital of the empire, 
                        Lux, professors like Theodore and Ariadne can thrive. Certain institutions are outside of the political landscape, 
                        like Academies. Accompanying them are the Mage Towers, and the Castles. There are three methods of power in this world, 
                        the stylus, mana, and the sword. While might does not make right, in this world having power allows you to protect those 
                        who you love from everyone else. So, it is only natural that everyone seeks power, either through the academy, the mage tower, 
                        or the castles, all of which are institutions dedicated to passing down their disciplines. <br><br>

                        That being said, Ed wanted to learn all of the three simultaneously. So, he left the house to go in the backyard one afternoon 
                        and took out his sword. The wooden sword that he was given was modeled after a gladius. Every day, he would run around the 
                        mound of the cottage, slowly increasing his laps, work out his body, practice his footwork and breathing, and then practice 
                        swinging the sword. Ed taught himself based on a book that was titled: "Philosophical Debates on Swordsmanship", which stressed 
                        the importance of the basics and placed them on a pedestal compared to techniques, which were only ever auxiliary. Afterward, 
                        he would meditate while in contact with his focus, a device that helps prospective mages. A focus is a crystal ball that helps 
                        take generic mana from its user and helps to train and increase mana capacity. To wrap up his day, Ed would try to put a dent 
                        in the Library in his room. Suspiciously, he never seemed to make any noticeable progress, even after a few weeks. It was 
                        like there were more and more books brought into his room, replacing the ones that he had finished. If anything, Ed enjoyed 
                        learning the different pathways ahead of him.
