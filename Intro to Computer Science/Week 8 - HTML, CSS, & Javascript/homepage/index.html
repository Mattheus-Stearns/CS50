					<h2>Motivations</h2>

                    <p>
                        Honestly, I would say that one of my <i>main</i> <b>motivations</b> <u>throughout life</u> is a continued ability
                        to learn about the world around me. Fundamentally how I interact with the world is through devouring the learnings
                        that it offers me. To most, it could be interpreted that my current modus operandi is one that is very sterile and
                        devoid of human interaction, because my hobbies inhibit real life connections. I go straight from classes to studying, 
                        and when I am not studying I am reading web novels online, joining in on dnd sessions hosted online, playing video games,
                        or <s>accelerating my balding by trying to make my own programs work</s> enriching my own experience interacting with 
                        life forms that exist in the binary world. To me, my hobbies allow me to experience different worlds beyond my peers, 
                        but worlds that nonetheless explore interesting social dilemmas and are most of the time didactic in some manner. <br><br>
                        But, I can agree that social connection is something to be desired, and at times, I do feel like my hobbies, understanding
                        of the world, and viewpoint - all convictions that limit my own interactions with my peers - are harmful. And yet, these
                        convictions of mine are fundamentally what makes me me. I have both experienced betrayal so often and been so critical
                        of how society is organised that I find it hard to motivate myself to make friends. I do have friends, its just that 
                        they are very few and far between.
