I think what I would do is for every user that has a certain song in their top 100, I would calculate the aura of that song and then append it to a relational database.
Then, when another user has a song that was in a previous user's wrapped, all it has to do is reference the database and it doesn't have to calculate the value again. If the
song is one that is appearing for the first time in the top 100, then that could spark spotify calculating the aura by running SQL code something like this:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS auras (
    FOREIGN KEY(song_id) REFERENCES songs(id),
    aura REAL
)

INSERT INTO auras (song_id, aura)
VALUES (song_id, SELECT AVG(energy + valence + danceability) FROM songs)

Although I am not completely sure if its correct, because I cannot debug this code, this is the general idea. The audio aura for an individual listener could then be a
weighted aggregate of their song profile, where the number one song of a listener would have a higher weight than the number one hundred song.

This might not be a perfect calculation of the aura of the listener, and it might be better to have the weighting of the songs be based off of the time listened to each song,
to represent what the listener is actually listening to and the time that they spend listening to it.
